# Microeconometrics.jl

This package provides support for microeconometric estimation. It supports complex weighted data and covariance structures (e.g., clustered). Please report bugs by [opening an issue](https://github.com/lbittarello/Microeconometrics.jl/issues/new). Information about specific versions can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/lbittarello/Microeconometrics.jl/releases).

## Supported estimators

More models are planned. If your preferred model is not currently available, [file an issue](https://github.com/lbittarello/Microeconometrics.jl/issues/new) or [contribute](#contributing)!
